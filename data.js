1. Somehow find a slime mold and see if you can interact with it for some form of navigational design (navigation of book?)

2. Explore Physarium Algorithm and use it to create layouts (spreads/inter-spreads)
   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210650221000511

3. Explore creating matrix with book spreads, (spreads, sheet, page)
   I don't know how this works, will have to study a little. But essentially, there would be a few dimensions,
   - the spread which is the visual spread that appears and you design on,
   - then the actual sheets before they are bound.
   - Z axis relationships between individual pages.
   And if you have a representation for this, you can use this space for physarium algorithms.

4. Wave function collapse with book spreads + spread layouts even...
   like taxonomic informations systems or puzzle books or smth. (RM book ali class)

5. Excel sheets, table generated printed out... Can be filled in with text and then can be scanned, do simple ocr and have easy access for data visualisation and stuff and also ease of handwriting...
   Can go further and think about what ways to interpret hand drawings/writing...  

		`),

6. Executing computations physically. 
   Like the typesize + leading relationship wheel, or graph multiplication, addition and stuff.

7. Printing methods based on print masters and stuff, but perhaps with paper. Eg. ink transfer kind of stuff. Waxy prints, negative for water based smth to pass thru and print? a sieve sort of? Ponder...

8. Desiginig italo calvino's books, or Arcadia  and incorporating structure of narrative or space in his books into the structure/form of the book
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_(play)

9. Publishing a paper on procedural bookmaking?

10. What is the relationship of sin/cos and circles
    I'm just curious, probably a quick exercise and a quick zine (1 day project)

11. Voronoi typesetting/layouting?
    Use voronoi algorithms for typesetting text. Maybe plot text on points, or create a grid/structure using the algorithm and play in it.

12. Lisajous curve table for typographic ratios
